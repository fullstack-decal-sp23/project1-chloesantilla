    <p> Majoring in Cognitive Science, minoring in Data Science, and obtaining a certificate in Innovative Design.</p>
    <p> Hi, my name is Chloe but you can refer to me as Sommie. I am a Sophomore currently involved with Pilipinx organizations on campus that aim to help students pursuing higher education through educational support, resource workshops, and programs that allow alumni to offer support and mentorship. I am very involved in my community. This semester, I am part of the 48th production of Pilipinx Cultural Night, dedicated to showcasing our culture through traditional and modern dance, song, and play. I am enthusiastic, hardworking, and dedicated to learn more about design and technology! </p>



    <div class="header-row">
        <h1> Work </h1>
    </div>

    <h3> Present </h3>
        <p> I am currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as user research and interaction methods. Soon, I will be learning React and Figma. </p>
    <h4> </h4>
    <h3>Retention</h3>
        <p> I spearheaded social events such as the Transfer Picnic on the Glade, Board Game Night, and multiple Study Jams, where we reserved classrooms and catered food to students during midterms and finals. I also helped in the creation of the QT-BIPOC Wellness and Makibeki Scholarship. </p>

    <h3> Recruitment </h3>
        <p> Under the recruitment component, we organized and executed Shadow Weekend, which outreached to high school juniors and seniors interested in pursuing higher education. We provided them transportation to campus from Central Valley and around the Bay Area in a two night, three day program that allowed them to explore their major interests, get insight into the UC application, and support with navigating financial aid </p>
